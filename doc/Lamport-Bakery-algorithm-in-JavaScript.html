<h1>Lamport's Bakery algorithm in JavaScript</h1>
<h2>a.in.the.k@gmail.com</h2>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper presents implementation of the original Lamport's Bakery algorithm [1] in JavaScript language. 
Our goal was to implement clear and simple rewrite of the original pseudo-code [1] to JavaScript, 
with maximum stress to similarity. With this in mind, the algorithm can be verified 
using the original proof of correctness [1].
We also provide test case showing that "synchronization" 
may be necessary in certain browsers and our bakery implementation can be used as possible solution. 
We believe that implemented solution is much more elegant, readable and correct than the existing
Wallace variation [2] widelly spread in the web. 

<h2>Browsers - the need for mutual exclusion ?</h2>
<h3>Testcase</h3>
Let's have a function representing long task with the following logic:
<code>
/**
generate rundom number C
increment top.shared variable C times, 
decrement top.shared variable C times
value of top.shared should be the same before and after the method was stared. 
**/
function longTaskUnsafe(window,strMethod)
{
	var c=Math.random()* 10000;
	top.Log.append(window,"S "+strMethod+" longTask:"+top.shared);
	for(var i=0;i&lt;c;i++)
	{
		top.shared++;
	}
	for(var i=0;i&lt;c;i++)
	{
		top.shared--;
	}
	top.Log.append(window,"E "+strMethod+" longTask:"+top.shared);
}
</code>
Let's have FRAMESET containing 5 FRAMEs. Each FRAME loads page with onload event handler <i>h2()</i>, 
plus FRAMESET itself has onload handler <i>h1</i> defined.
<br>
If frameset is displayed, browser stars loading frame pages, and executes 5 handlers h2() and one handler h1. 
In theory, several instances of h2() can run concurrently. 
However, when tested in browser, results seem OK: handlers are run in sequence, and top.shared  has consistent values 0.
<code>
0	?f1	:	S h2 longTask:0
36	?f1	:	E h2 longTask:0
38	?f2	:	S h2 longTask:0
44	?f2	:	E h2 longTask:0
46	?f3	:	S h2 longTask:0
47	?f3	:	E h2 longTask:0
49	?f4	:	S h2 longTask:0
174	?f4	:	E h2 longTask:0
182	?f5	:	S h2 longTask:0
182	?f5	:	E h2 longTask:0
182	?fs	:	S h1 longTask:0
255	?fs	:	E h1 longTask:0
</code> 
Now, let's introduce window.confirm between increment and decrement parts of the function:
<code>
function longTaskUnsafe(window,strMethod)
{
	var c=Math.random()* 10000;
	top.Log.append(window,"S "+strMethod+" longTask:"+top.shared);
	for(var i=0;i&lt;c;i++)
	{
		top.shared++;
	}
	<b>window.confirm(location.search+":"+strMethod);</b>
	for(var i=0;i&lt;c;i++)
	{
		top.shared--;
	}
	top.Log.append(window,"E "+strMethod+" longTask:"+top.shared);
}
</code>
This, introduces interesting results in some browsers:
<h4>MSIE, Firefox, Opera (not Chrome,Safari)</h4>
<code>
0	?f1	:	S h2 longTask:0
24	?f2	:	S h2 longTask:2043
80	?f3	:	S h2 longTask:8850
123	?f4	:	S h2 longTask:13941
156	?f5	:	S h2 longTask:17602
1534	?f5	:	E h2 longTask:17602
1862	?f4	:	E h2 longTask:13941
2112	?f3	:	E h2 longTask:8850
2294	?f2	:	E h2 longTask:2043
2443	?f1	:	E h2 longTask:0
2444	?fs	:	S h1 longTask:0
2629	?fs	:	E h1 longTask:0
</code>
Log shows, that while h2() in frame f1 was waiting for confirm, 
browser started execution of h2() in different frame f2. Which started with non zero value (proving that f1.h2() has not finished yet). 
<br>
This shows that second function can be executed by browser's JavaScript engine, even if 
previous function was not finished.
Investigation why and when this can happen is out of the scope of this paper.
Browsers are known to use several threads for FRAME, IMG, XmlHttpRequest,XSLTProcessor, Flesh and other object,
and it is up to vendor how these threads interacts with JavaScript engine.
<p>
<b>Conclusion: Let's have two function f() and f'(). Under "certain circumstances", f'() can start execution even if f() has not finished yet.</b>
<p>
<b>
We believe, this observation (with none explanation) 
can be used as motivation to implement
mutual exclusion implementation at the level of JavaScript functions. 
</b>
<h2>Pseudo-code rewrite</h2>
<h3>Original pseodo-code</h3>
<img src="Bakery.png" alt="Original pseudocode">
Our goal is to create "1:1 re-write" of the original pseudo-code in JavaScript, 
to keep correctness verification as simple as possible.
JavaScript implementation introduces one main challenge:
<ul>
	<li>implement "do nothing", represented by <i>goto L2</i>,<i>goto L3</i> in the original pseudo code</li>
</ul>
Solution for this is setTimeout function. Using this construct however introduces another problems:
<ul>
	<li>Repeat only <b>part of the loop body</b> with <b>"remembered arguments",</b><i>j</i></li>
	<li>Skip L2 check for certain <i>j</i> if already checked</li>
	<li>Call original function (critical section) using setTimeout, 
		 with original context <i>this</i> and orginal <i>arguments</i> </li>
	
</ul> 
All these challenges can be solved using build in language constructs.
<h3>Proposed JavaScript version</h3>
<img src="BakeryJavaScript.png" alt="Proposed JavaScript code">
<h3>Studying our code</h3>
<p>
Bakery.js code, creates <i>synchronization mechanism</i>, that allows us to turn original functions f,f' into 
<i>synchronized functions</i>. 
Synchronized in this context means, that if "f synchronized over bakery instance b" is running, 
no other f' synchronized over the same bakery instance b will run. Second function f' will wait until there
is no other synchronized method over b running. This is achieved by defering the execution of second function f' using setTimeout.
<p>
Critical sections of original algorithm are represented by whole functions f and f'. 
Processes are rougly represented by logical threads, executing the method.
<p>
Gained effect is similar to synchronized methods in Java language, with explicit 
synchronization over specific monitor b (this is just for illustration, we have not reached the semantics of synchronized in Java).
<h4>Making functions synchronized</h4>
<p>
There are several ways to register a handler, and several types of functions used as handlers.
Sample shows some of the combinations and challenges to be solved, when making function synchronized. 
In short, if the original handler was passed certain <i>arguments</i> and was called with certain context <i>this</i>, 
the same arguments and this context must be available in synchronized handler.
Our style emphases nondestructive coding, which means 
we try to keep the original functions intact, create synchronized wrappers
and change handler registration from original function to synchronized version.
<code>
// before:
function f1(obj,arg1,arg2)
{
	Log.append(window,"f1:"+obj.nodeName+","+arg1+","+arg2);
}
&lt;img id="img1" width=100 height=100 src="sample.png" onload="f1(this,'a1','a2');">
// after:
var f1s=b.createSynchronizedDelegate(f1);
&lt;img id="img1" width=100 height=100 src="sample.png" onload="f1s(this,'a1','a2');">
</code>
That was demonstration of old style (DHTML) registration where user enters the name 
of handler with optional parameters as part of the HTML structure.
Newer approaches uses onload property (traditional) or addEventListener DOM API to register handler.
In the second case, the scoping and this must be kept. 
<code>
// before
&lt;img id="img2" width=100 height=100 src="sample.png">
&lt;script>
(function()
{
	var scope="s1";
	function f2()
	{
		Log.append(window,"f2:"+this.nodeName+","+scope);
	}
	document.getElementById("img2").onload=f2;
})();
// after
// note that this can be done outside of original f2 scope
document.getElementById("img2").onload=b.createSynchronizedDelegate(
	document.getElementById("img2").onload); 
</code>
<p>
As seen, our Bakery.js implementation allows to concert existing code regardless on the
registration or handler type without change to the original methods code and with minimal
lines of extra code required. 
<p>
Of course, when writing new code from scratch, selected methods can be easily defined as synchronized
without exposing the unsafe function. 
<p>
<b>
Note: We limited the scope to functions without return value. 
Which is typical to hanlers and is not considered an issue. 
</b>
<h4>Behaviour explained</h4>
<p>
Call to bakery.createSynchronizedDelegate takes reference to original function <i>originalFunction</i>, 
and returns reference to new function <i>newFunction</i>. 
This new function should be used as new event handler.
When <b>creating the newFunction</b>,"process" is registered with bakery, but without performing "choosing phase".
When <b>newFunction is called for the first time</b> by browser (event occured),
the "choosing" phase executes,original context (this) and arguments (args) are stored.
Waiting loop is encapsulated by attemp function defined inside the scope of newFunction 
which means it can access that,args and j variables. 
Finally call to newFunction also executes attempt().
Attempt itself performes checks labeled L2 and L3 in the original pseodo-code. If those are not satisfied, 
attemp defers itself with setTimeout and exists. 
If l2 is satisfied it is marked as done, and attemt defered again to perform L3 check. 
Next "defered loop" does not check for L2 again. 
When both L2+l3 are satisfied for j, j is incremented (L2 flag cleared), 
and loop is repeated for next j. 
When all values of j are checked, original method is called 
by applying original context (that) and arguments (args).
Critical section is left. 
<h4>Side effects</h4>
When ticket choosing is moved from newFunction call to newFunction creation, the bakery can be used for ordering
of the event handlers. This is one interesting feature not intentionaly implemented. 
Order of createSynchronizedDelegate calls will dictate the order of handlers executed.
Combined with several bakery instances on the same page can provide interesting functionality, 
often needed in asynchronous interaction scenarios. 
<code>
// modified version with choosing in creation or first call 
// introduced parameter explicitNumber
// allows user to specify explicit number, not 1+max number generated by bakery.

Bakery.prototype.createSynchronizedDelegate=function(originalFunction,explicitNumber)
{
	var b=this; 
	var i=b.choosing.length;
	b.choosing[i]=0;
	b.number[i]=0;
	
	if(explicitNumber!=null) //extra optional choosing block in creation
	{
		b.choosing[i]=1;
		b.number[i]=explicitNumber;
		b.choosing[i]=0;
	}
	
	function newFunction()
	{
		// store original context and params of method call 
		var that=this;
		var args=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);

		if(explicitNumber==null)  // if chosen in creation, skip
		{
			// original choosing block in run
			b.choosing[i]=1;
			b.number[i]=1+Math.max.apply(null,b.number);
			b.choosing[i]=0;
		}	
		.....

<h2>Existing solutions</h2>
When googling for some existing JavaScript sources, 
"Wallace variation" has been propagated strongly.
Wikipedia as well contained link to this version of algorithm at the time of writing.
<h3>Wallace variation</h3>
Basically all my <b>subjective cons</b> of Wallace variation, 
could be explained by authors little usage of native JavaScript features (closures, references)
and tendencies towards OO:
<ul>
	<li>Incorrect ? (L2,L3 conditions merged into one, L2 re-evaluated if already passed)</li>
	<li>Pretty far away from original pseudocode</li>
	<li>Ugly bakery. Strings for setTimeout,..., reimplementation of sparse array,..., unreliable new Date()</li>
	<li>Ugly clients. Lot of code needed, shifts developers from 
		functional (natural) to Command pattern (artifical and verbose) implementation.</li>
	<li>Error prone. Badly implemented clients (Commands), may break bakery (Mutex).</li>	
</ul>
All this is subjective, but all mentioned dislikes has been partial driver for our proposed version. 
<h3>Others</h3>
So far we have not found other implementations in JavaScript. Or at least not closely related to 
Wallace variation.
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
Out solution presents simple and clear implementation of Bakery algorithm that can be used to ensure
mutual exclusion of event handlers execution in threaded browsers.
We have identified these benefits of our solution (compared to other existing solutions):
<ul>
	<li>Clear original pseudo-code rewrite - easy verification of correctness</li>
	<li>Easy client code - "1 line of code" needed to change original unsynchronized handler 
		to synchronized version. </li>
	<li>Non destructive client code - can deal with variety of code styles, with redefinition 
		of handlers outside of original code, can preserve original functions 
		or by used as encasulation and hiding of unsafe code.</li> 
	<li>Client style code is kept "functional" not OO oriented which is typical for handlers.</li>
	<li>Original handler arguments and context is honored, without extra coding effort.</li>
	<li>Multiple handlers with the same name can be synchronized</li>
	<li>Handlers can be to synchronized over "several bakeries" not only one global.</li>
	<li>Code has been tested on latest version of common browsers (MSIE 6,7,8, Firefox 3.x,Opera 9,10, Safari 3,4, Chrome 2)</li>
</ul>
We have identified these problems with our solution:
<ul>
	<li>Performance degradation //TODO: should be measured</li>
</ul>
