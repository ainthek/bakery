# bakery - Lamport's bakery algorithm

Very old project....

## Outline

This paper presents implementation of the original Lamport's Bakery algorithm [1] in JavaScript language. Our goal was to implement clear and simple rewrite of the original pseudo-code [1] to JavaScript, with maximum stress to similarity. With this in mind, the algorithm can be verified using the original proof of correctness [1]. We also provide test case showing that "synchronization" may be necessary in certain browsers and our bakery implementation can be used as possible solution. We believe that implemented solution is much more elegant, readable and correct than the existing Wallace variation [2] widelly spread in the web.
